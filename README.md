# Ng Strt Bootstrap

This is a boilerplate starter project to build Angular applications. The stylings are based on the Bootstrap CSS framework and Firebase as a backend. The goal of this project is to be as barebone basics as possible but still keep as many basic features as necessary. It does not aim to be yet another fully featured template!

## Basic features

The project was built using Angular CLI and thus follows that architecture. The basic functionality included:
- Common layouts
- Authentication system
- User account
- Toasts and alerts
- Few directives and shared components

## Getting started

To use the project clone it, install the depencies and off you go.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philister16/angular-bootstrap-starter.git
cd angular-bootstrap-starter
ng serve
```
